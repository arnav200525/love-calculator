**Love Calculator**
A simple, web-based love compatibility calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This playful project calculates a compatibility score between two people based on the ASCII values of the characters in their names. It's meant for entertainment purposes and just for fun — don't take the results seriously!
The Love Calculator is a fun project where users can enter their name and their crush's name to get a randomly determined "compatibility score" based on ASCII character values.

**Features**
  - Input fields for both names.
  - Simple ASCII-based logic to generate a compatibility score.
  - Stylish, responsive UI.
  - Displays compatibility result on the same page.
  - Entirely client-side (no server or database required).

**How It Works**
  - User enters their name and their crush’s name.
  - The script converts each character in both names to its ASCII value.
  - It then performs a simple operation (like summing, averaging, or modding) on the ASCII values to generate a "love percentage."
  - The result is displayed as a compatibility score out of 100%.

**Technologies Used**
  - HTML: Structure of the web page.
  - CSS: Styling and layout.
  - JavaScript: Core logic for calculating and displaying compatibility.
